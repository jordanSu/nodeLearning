## Description
This is solutions of promise-it-wont-hurt I wrote

However, there is some [verification problem](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt/issues/102) in Exercise 9 and 10.
So you maybe want to solve it by [rewriting exercise.js](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt/pull/98/commits/18662a8272c72095bf3d957c0f8f188cdbc1726f)

## This workshopper brings you
- A new object `Promise` introduced in ES5.
- Pending -> Fulfill or Reject. Once decided there is no way back to the other state.
- You can return value in your `then` function, Promise will convert it to a promise object.
- Try to add a error handler at the end of your promise chain.

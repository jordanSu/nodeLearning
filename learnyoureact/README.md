# learnyoureact Practice

## Description
This is solutions of learnyoureact I wrote.<br>
And I believe the verifications of the last 3 exercises are broken.<br>
So I am not sure about my answer will actually pass or not.

Also when I tried to do exercise 8<br>
I found there are some peer dependencies problem in npm<br>
The dependencies I used in order to pass exercise 8 are list in package.json.<br>
So you can try my dependencies settings if you encounter the same problem as mine.
